Windows Authentication (also known as Integrated Windows Authentication or NTLM authentication) allows users to authenticate against a Windows domain without entering their credentials explicitly, assuming they are logged into a Windows domain-joined machine. This method is useful in intranet scenarios where users are already authenticated by their Windows credentials. Hereâ€™s how you can implement Windows Authentication with Angular and .NET Core:

### Angular Frontend Integration

Windows Authentication primarily operates on the backend (.NET Core) and does not require specific implementation on the frontend (Angular) beyond ensuring CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is properly configured to allow requests from your Angular frontend to your .NET Core backend.

### .NET Core Backend Integration

#### 1. Configure Windows Authentication

Configure Windows Authentication in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();

    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();

    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

#### 2. Secure API Endpoints

Use `[Authorize]` attribute to secure API endpoints:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/data")]
public class DataController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    [Authorize]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        // Access user identity
        var userName = User.Identity.Name;
        // Return data based on user identity
        return Ok(new { message = "Protected data accessed successfully", userName });
    }
}
```

#### 3. Optional: Use Group Policy to Configure Authentication

In some cases, you may need to adjust group policy settings to ensure Windows Authentication works seamlessly. Here are steps you might take:

1. **Ensure Integrated Windows Authentication is Enabled**:
   - Go to Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off.
   - Under Internet Information Services > World Wide Web Services > Security, ensure that "Windows Authentication" is checked.

2. **Configure Intranet Zone Settings**:
   - Open Internet Explorer > Internet Options > Security > Local Intranet > Sites.
   - Ensure that "Automatically detect intranet network" is checked or add your domain to the list of local intranet sites.

### Summary

- **Windows Authentication** allows seamless authentication using Windows credentials.
- **Angular** applications do not require specific implementation for Windows Authentication beyond ensuring CORS is properly configured.
- **.NET Core** backend configures Windows Authentication middleware and uses `[Authorize]` attribute to secure endpoints based on user identity.
- Ensure proper group policy and server settings to enable Integrated Windows Authentication and handle intranet zone configurations as needed.
